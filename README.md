# Project Everest

### Round 2 of Development (Senior Project Quarter 1)
___
#### Newly Implemented Features
##### Variable Player Number
***(Completed 4/30/19)***
After much work combing through all of the game's systems that were initially designed with only two players in mind, the code has been changed to allow for 2 to 4 players to play together at once. The number of players is now selected at the initial menu and carried into each scene using a static class.

##### Loading Screen Functionality
***(Completed 5/01/19)***
As a precaution to some computers being unable to run the game as fast as my own, I have built in placeholder loading screens that will eventually provide the player some indication that the game hasn't frozen while they wait for it to load.
